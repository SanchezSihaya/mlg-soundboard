# MLG Soundboard using Web Audio API

## Description
This features a simple soundboard using Web Sound API and distortion effects. 
You can find the distortion effects on https://github.com/web-audio-components/overdrive.
Forked from https://github.com/tst/mlg-soundboard


## Installation
Place repo in web root directory
put your sound files in the root directory (the same folder as index.html)
add the filenames to memeboard.js (/js/board.js)

## Usage

It's tested on Firefox 32.0 (current version) and Chrome 34 (current) and will work likely for future version.
Other browsers don't seem to work because they haven't implemented the Web Audio API, yet.
